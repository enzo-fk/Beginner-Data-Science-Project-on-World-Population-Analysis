# Beginner-Data-Science-Project-on-World-Population-Analysis
The objective of our project is to analyze global population data to uncover patterns and relationships between various demographic and socio-economic metrics, such as population size, density, fertility rates, migration, and urbanization levels. By collecting real-time data from the Worldometers website, the code aims to preprocess and standardize these metrics, engineer new features like log-transformed population and urban-rural ratios, and train a predictive model using a Random Forest Regressor. The primary focus is to identify key factors influencing population size while evaluating model performance through error metrics and visualizing the impact of influential features. This analysis provides insights into how different countries vary in terms of population dynamics, helping to understand the demographic structure and potential growth trends globally.
